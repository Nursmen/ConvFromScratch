# Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation from scratch using only the NumPy library! This repository contains a fully functional CNN with both forward and backward propagation coded entirely with NumPy, showcasing how deep learning models can be built without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Features:
- <b style='color: green;'>Pure NumPy Implementation:</b> All operations and functions are implemented using NumPy, providing a clear understanding of the underlying mathematics.
- <b style='color: green;'>Forward Propagation:</b>
Implemented to pass inputs through the network and compute the output.
- <b style='color: green;'>Backward Propagation:</b>
Implemented to update the network's weights based on the error of the output.
